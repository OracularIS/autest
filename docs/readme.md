# Introduction

Smart AuTest is a powerful and intelligent automated testing solution purpose-built for **Blue Yonder WMS** (Warehouse Management System) environments. 

It is designed to eliminate manual testing efforts and streamline the testing lifecycle across MOCA, RF, and Web UI-based use cases. By enabling seamless execution and validation of diverse test types, Smart AuTest empowers QA teams to deliver faster, more accurate, and more reliable results across warehouse operations.

The solution is fully cloud-based, secure, and scalable ensuring accessibility, tenant-level security, and zero local installation requirements.


## Features

### Multi-Platform Test Support
- **MOCA-Based Tests**: Execute backend-level validations using MOCA commands.
- **RF-Based Tests**: Test mobile terminal workflows using MTF forms.
- **Web UI-Based Tests**: Simulate and validate interactions in the WMS web interface.

### Run Sets for End-to-End Scenarios
- Group multiple test cases into **Run Sets** to simulate real-world WMS workflows from start to finish.
- Ensure all parts of the system interact seamlessly by combining MOCA, RF, and Web UI tests in a single flow.

### Stress Testing Capability
