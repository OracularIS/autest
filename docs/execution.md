### Overview

This guide provides a detailed walkthrough for executing run sets in AuTest, including explanations of the various grids, tabs, and their purposes. 

In this demonstration, we will be executing run set `BASE_INB_000000_CREATE_TO_DISPATCH`. 

![](Images/execute001.png)

**What this Run set does?**

The runset is designed to manage the complete inbound process from create to dispatch inbound order. Specifically, it:

- Copies the source rcvtrk data and creates new rcvtrk.

- Checks in the trailer, ensuring all required details are validated.

- Identifies and receives inventory to physical location.

- Closes and dispatches the truck, completing the process.

### Run Set Steps

Following steps will be used in run set `BASE_INB_000000_CREATE_TO_DISPATCH`.

| **Step (Test)**                                        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BASE_INB_0001100_COPY_TEMPLATE_RCVTRK_MOCA_V001`      | This step copies a `RCVTRK` record and creates new `rcvtrk`, `rcvinv`, and `rcvlin` records for our test run. It utilizes the `uc_test_exec_seqnum` variable to ensure unique record creation. |
| `BASE_INB_0002100_TRLR_CKIN_MOCA_V001`                 | Using `uc_test_exec_seqnum`, this step checks in the truck against an open door.                                                                                             |
| `BASE_INB_0003100_IDENTIFY_MOCA_V001`                  | Now that we have a truck that is checked in as well, it will identify all inventory in the truck. We have created this to support ASN scenario as well â€“ so if truck inventory is already identified it simply returns success. |
| `BASE_INB_0004100_ALLOCATE_LOCATION_PICKUP_DEPOSIT_MOCA_V001` | We use this test twice and use test case concept. The first run moves inventory to receive stage and the next one will allocate a putaway location and drop it there. These steps support the concepts to run in a stress test mode as well. So when run normally, they will process everything in the truck. But when run in stress test mode they will process one record only. |
| `BASE_INB_0009100_CLOSE_DISPATCH_RCVTRK_MOCA_V001`     | Closes and dispatches the truck.                                                                                                                                             |

**Step 4: View Results**

- After clicking OK, an execution of run set will start and an [Execution Console](#overview-of-execution-console) will get open to show an execution of run set and its associated tests. 

### Overview of Execution Console?

An Execution Console is the central interface for monitoring and analyzing the execution of a runset. It consists of multiple tabs and grids, each designed to provide specific information about the execution process and results. 

The Execution Page consists of eight tabs:
    
  1. Results
  2. Console
  3. Test Actions
  4. Error (appears only when one or more steps fail during execution)
  5. Commands on Target Env
  6. Test Commands
  7. Execution Details
  8. Run Set Execution

![](Images/execute010.png)

### Tabs Functionality

Each tab provides specific details related to the execution process, which are dynamically updated during the runset execution.

#### 1. Results

![](Images/execute009.png)

The Results Tab is divided into three grids:
  1. **First Grid: Arguments and Values**
     - Displays the arguments and their respective values used for the runset execution.
   
         ![](Images/execute011.png)

  2. **Second Grid: Execution Units and Details**
     - Shows the hierarchical structure of the execution, starting with the name of the runset at the top level.
      
         ![](Images/execute012.png)

     - Lists all the test steps one by one in sequential order during an execution with following detail:
       - Status
       - Message
       - Pre Exec?
       - Run Until?
       - Validate Cmd
       - Post Exec?
       - Elapsed
       - Expected MS
       - Elapsed Since MS
       - User ID
       - Warehouse ID
       - Device Code
       - Sort Sequence

     - The execution is displayed for each step: 
       - As it executes, the step we are executing is in yellow.

            ![](Images/execute014.png)

       - After successful execution it becomes green.

            ![](Images/execute015.png)

       - In case of an error it becomes red Indicates that the execution failed.

            ![](Images/execute016.png)

  3. **Third Grid: Executed Steps Result View**

     - When each row above is highlighted, the results associated with that specific MOCA snippet are displayed. This allows for an easy and direct examination of the outcomes linked to individual MOCA segments, ensuring clarity and facilitating a thorough review of the data provided in each snippet.
     - It includes five tabs:
          1. Result: Shows a grid containing the output of the command executed for the step.
          2. Command: Displays the name of the executed command.
          3. Command Expand: Presents the full syntax of the executed command, including the argument values.
          4. Argument: Lists all the arguments used during the execution of the step.

![](Images/execute026.png)

- The Results Tab dynamically updates as the runset progresses. It displays the execution units (2nd grid) and their statuses in real-time with coding scheme.
- Execution details for each step are populated in the 3rd grid when a step is clicked.

#### After Execution Completion

- Once the execution is complete, all tabs become available, showing detailed information for further analysis.

### Execution Console also shows what was executed

See the tab 'Commands on Target Env'
