## Introduction

The Smart AuTest suite is available in a subscription model. This implies that customers do not need to install any software in their ecosystem. The tests are launched from the Smart MOCA Client but the underlying data is managed from the cloud. 

## Key Features

1. **Cloud-Based Infrastructure**: All test data is stored and managed within the cloud, ensuring scalability, accessibility, and robust security measures.

2. **Seamless Integration**: Tests are launched directly from the Smart MOCA Client, providing a user-friendly interface for initiating and monitoring testing processes.

3. **Subscription Flexibility**: Customers can choose from various subscription options tailored to their specific needs, whether opting for a trial period to evaluate the suite's capabilities or committing to a permanent subscription for ongoing testing requirements.

4. **Effortless Setup**: The subscription model simplifies the onboarding process, allowing users to request a tenant through a straightforward web form. Once the request is submitted, Smart promptly handles the setup process, creating user accounts and providing necessary login credentials.

5. **Automated Confirmation**: Upon submission of the web form, key contacts receive a confirmation email containing essential details and login instructions. This automated process ensures a smooth transition for users into the Smart auTest environment.

6. **Trial Access**: During the trial period, organizations have access to both auTest and stress test functionalities, enabling comprehensive evaluation of the suite's capabilities and suitability for their testing requirements.
