## Introduction

This is a sample case study.  Going through the case study will allow us to visualize how an automated testing project may be approached:

### Gather existing test scripts
It helps if we have manual test scripts that are already in use which will be migrated to the automated testing suite.  For illustration note that a typical manual test script may look something like:
| Step | Description | Expected Result |
|------------------|-------|----|
| 1000 |Prepare an ASN| ASN Exists in the system |
| 1100 |Create a trailer and check it in | <ul> <li> Trailer Created </li> <li> Workflows for the check in (e.g. temperature) were prompted </li> <li>Item 3</li></ul> |
