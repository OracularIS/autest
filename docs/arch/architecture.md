# Architecture Overview

Autest is a smart automated testing framework designed to streamline the testing lifecycle for Blue Yonder (BY) processes.

By automating repetitive and critical testing tasks, Autest enhances the speed, consistency, and reliability of the overall testing process. 

Its architecture is structured into two key layers: 

**Maintenance** and **Execution** ensuring a clear separation of concerns and enabling scalable test operations across enterprise-grade systems.
