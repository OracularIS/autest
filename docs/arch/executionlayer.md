# Execution Layer 

The **Execution Layer** of Autest is responsible for running the tests defined and maintained in SmartApps.

Execution is managed through the **Autest Launcher**, a dedicated MOCA-based add-on, which interacts with the core BY environment to automate testing end-to-end.

It is responsible for several key functions, including:

#### 1. **Test Execution Management**
Autest Launcher allows users to execute:
- **Individual Test Cases**: Run isolated scenarios for unit testing or targeted verification.
- **Runsets**: Execute groups of related test cases in defined order.

#### 2. **Remote Server Configuration**
Before execution, testers can define runtime parameters for each environment:
- **Server Address**: Specify the host or remote server for BY execution.
- **Service & Port Configuration**: Define the port and MOCA service instance to be used.
- **User Authentication**: Enter valid credentials (User ID and Password) for secure access.
- **Warehouse & Context**: Select warehouse id, or contexts applicable to the test scenario.

#### 3. **Supported Test Types**
Autest supports a wide range of testing types critical to BY environments:
- **Regression Testing**: Revalidate core functions after updates.
- **Smoke Testing**: Quick health checks of major system components.
- **Unit Testing**: Validate specific components or logic blocks in isolation.
- **Stress/Load Testing**: Simulate high-load scenarios to measure system performance.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Automate complex workflows across multiple modules or systems.

#### 4. **Execution Monitoring and Logs**
- **Real-Time Visualization**: View progress and step-level results during test execution.
- **Result Retention**: Retrieve and review results of previously executed test runs for analysis or comparison.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Access detailed logs with timestamps, errors, execution steps, and system responses for in-depth debugging and diagnostics.

#### 5. **Reusable Runsets**

- Users can define a runset by providing all required execution parameters once (e.g., warehouse, service, port, user ID).
- The configured runset is saved and can be executed as many times as needed without re-entering the setup.
- This ensures consistency across executions and reduces time spent on repetitive configuration.
- Ideal for recurring test scenarios, such as regression cycles.

### Benefits of the Execution Layer:
- **Seamless Integration with MOCA**: Executes directly within the BY ecosystem, requiring no external test harness.
- **High Reliability**: Automated execution reduces human error and ensures consistent test behavior.
- **Scalable Test Coverage**: Supports parallel runs, bulk test execution, and flexible scheduling.
- **Actionable Insights**: Logs and results empower testers to quickly identify, reproduce, and fix issues.
